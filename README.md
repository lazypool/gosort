# Golang Sorting Algorithms

10 classic sorting algorithms implemented in Go with simple test functions.

## Build

```
go build
```

After build, you can find the ELF or EXE file under the project file, which can be called easily.

## Usage

Use `./gosort --help` for details, please.

```
Usage of ./gosort:
  -l int
    	the length of the array to be sorted. (default 20)
  -m int
    	the maximum of the array's number. (default 100)
  -n string
    	the name of sort method used to sort the numbers. 10 names are avaible:
    	bubble, bucket, counting, heap, insertion, merge, quick, radix, selection, shell (default "bubble")
```
